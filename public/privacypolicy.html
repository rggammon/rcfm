    <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, Squac collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
        date and time of each visitor request. Squac's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is
        to better understand how Squac's visitors use its website. From time to time, Squac may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
        its website.</p>
    <p>Squac also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
        logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://squ.ac blog posts. Squac only discloses logged in user
        and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.</p>

    <h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to Squac's websites choose to interact with Squac in ways that require Squac to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Squac gathers depends on the nature
        of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who log into https://squ.ac to authorize access to their name. 
        and email address.</p>
    <p><a href="#EmailName"><strong>Collection of Email Address and Name through Twitter login</strong></a> provides
        more information on handling of name and email address.

    <h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
        the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
        means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
        cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy covers the use of cookies by Squac and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
        you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms
        of service of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
        party sites, products or services.</p>

    <h2 id="PIIProtection">6. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Squac discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
        it on Squac's behalf or to provide services available at Squac's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
        disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
        of your home country; by using Squac's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Squac
        will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
        than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Squac discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
        other governmental request, or when Squac believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
        protect the property or rights of Squac, third parties or the public at large.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of https://squ.ac and have supplied your email address, Squac may occasionally send
        you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
        going on with Squac and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
        expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
        one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to
        your request or to help us support other users. Squac takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
        the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2 id="Analytics">10. Google Analytics and Azure Application Insights</h2>
    <p>Elaborating on <a href="#websitevisitors"><strong>Website Visitors</strong></a>, we use Google Analytics and 
        Azure Application Insights for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track your session usage,
        Google / Azure drops a cookie (_ga / ai_session) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser. This ID is anonymized and contains
        no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc. We also send Google / Azure your IP Address. We use these Analytics to
        track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is
        important to us for improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness. If you would like to access
        what browsing information we have - or ask us to delete any GA data - please delete your _ga cookies, reach out to
        us via webmaster@squ.ac, and/or install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-Out

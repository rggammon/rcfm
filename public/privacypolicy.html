    <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, Squac collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
        date and time of each visitor request. Squac's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is
        to better understand how Squac's visitors use its website. From time to time, Squac may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
        its website.</p>
    <p>Squac also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
        logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://squ.ac blog posts. Squac only discloses logged in user
        and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.</p>

    <h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to Squac's websites choose to interact with Squac in ways that require Squac to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Squac gathers depends on the nature
        of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://squ.ac to provide a username and
        email address.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
        the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
        means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
        cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy covers the use of cookies by Squac and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
        you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms
        of service of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
        party sites, products or services.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Remarketing">6. Squac uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
    <p>Squac uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors
        to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for
        example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google
        search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies
        to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our
        own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
    <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to
        you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.
    </p>

    <h2 id="PIIProtection">7. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Squac discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
        it on Squac's behalf or to provide services available at Squac's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
        disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
        of your home country; by using Squac's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Squac
        will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
        than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Squac discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
        other governmental request, or when Squac believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
        protect the property or rights of Squac, third parties or the public at large.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of https://squ.ac and have supplied your email address, Squac may occasionally send
        you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
        going on with Squac and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
        expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
        one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to
        your request or to help us support other users. Squac takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
        the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2 id="Stats">8. Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>Squac may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Squac may display this information
        publicly or provide it to others. However, Squac does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Cookies">9. Cookies</h2>
    <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Squac uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by
        others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
        provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Squac uses cookies to help Squac identify and track
        visitors, their usage of https://squ.ac, and their website access preferences. Squac visitors who do not wish to
        have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Squac's
        websites, with the drawback that certain features of Squac's websites may not function properly without the aid
        of cookies.</p>
    <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to
        Squac's use of cookies.</p>

        Squac's sole discretion. Squac encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
        Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance
        of such change.</p>
